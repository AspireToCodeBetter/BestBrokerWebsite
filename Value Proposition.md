Benefits of a realtor:

+ The realtor will send you MLS listings, within whatever parameters you set, and you can look through them , just like in Zillow - but BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE. There is far less mis-information in the MLS listings, and far more detailed information. (Like how much is HOA dues for the condos, etc.)
+ They can also coach you through the process of purchasing, and be very helpful in finding out areas you never even thought of looking. They are great guides to the housing market, and can help you fine tune your search.
+ They tour you around and make all the calls to visit homes, and they are already aware of your preferences. You will see more properties you should be looking at instead of random ones you found on zillow.
+ There are too many to list....

Warning about SOME real estate agents or realtors:
+ Just don't fall for SOME realtor's bullshit sales tactics.
+ Their incentive is to get you into a house as FAST as possible to minimize their working time, and maximize their cash per hour.
+ Their methods may include glorifying home ownership, suggesting fantastic, daydreamy visions, and grandeur to you in EVERY house you look at,
telling you to highball bid on homes and scare you into thinking if you don't do this, then your low offer will 'insult' the seller and you will lose your chance of getting your dream house forever. (this helps them purchase quickly)
